# Password-Manager-Java

My Password Manager performs a couple of options: 
It allows easy Registration for new users ,and easy Login/Logout for existing users.
It allows passwords to be stored for the user in an encrypted form using AES encryption in an excel file.
The main window of the program has on the top right side a local date and time for user convenience.

It also has the following options:"
1.Add a new Password to the system and an option to add a strong random password that the system creates for the user.
2.Remove a Password by Website and UserName."
3.Open any site that the user desires from the list of passwords stored in the system (Main Table).
4.Option to Login automatically with google-chrome only to the following sites: Facebook and Linkedin.
5.The option to Decrypt (Reveal) any Password the user wants from the table.
6.The option to Simulate an Entrance to any Website the user wants from the table.
